			<p class="HomeP">Given the opportunity to create an experimental comic, I thought about wordless comics. For this project, I took a hallmark of western literature - shakespearean plays, and created a 10-page wordless comic to test the limitations of visual communication. Inspired by the emoji-based "Macbeth #killingit" from "OMG Shakespeare".</p>

			<p class="HomeP">UX to me is in part about balancing competing needs of users on limited screen real estate, but I did not feel that current models such as sitemap, and userflow, directly relate personas and in-product experiences. As such, I endeavoured to find a bridge that will help us think about how user journeys translate into the structure of a digital system.</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Hi, thank you for visiting! I am Marvin, a student at the Parsons School of Design, and I enjoy designing digital systems.</p>

				<p>Currently, I am partaking in “Applications of Digital Analytics and Management Strategies in UX Processes”, a 5 week workshop (Nov-Dec) privately organized by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielhjames/">Daniel James</a>, who previously held positions at BCG (Consultant), Goldman Sachs (Analyst), and Capital One Labs (Director of Product Management). During which, I am able to develop a real life product from ideation to launch, with a focus on using marketing analytics, usability tests, as well as financing strategies to validate and enhance design. It covers all things design related for a startup from branding and web-deisgn, to app design. Best of all, it aligns with my interest in problem solving with design, which is what motivated me to transition into UX.</p>

				<p>In my last three years as a college student, I spent a lot of time exploring different fields, honing my design capabilities along the way. I learnt to manage semester-long projects (HKU Architecture 2016-2018) - to handle photography professionally (New York Fashion Week 2018 F/W Workshop) - the conventions of branding (Constant, Creative Intern Summer 2018) - as well as the fundamentals of UX (General Assembly UX Design Circuit Summer 2018). My major in illustration at Parsons School of Design supports my experimentation in visual communication.</p>
