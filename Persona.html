				<h4>Skills: Sitemap, Personas, User Journey, User Flow</h4>
				<h1>How do you bridge the gap between personas and user flow?</h1>
				<br><br>
				<p>UX to me is in part about balancing the competing needs of users on a limited screen real estate, but I did not feel that current models such as sitemap, and userflow, directly relate personas and in-product experiences. During this project, I attempted to find a different way of representing that will help us think about how user journeys translate into the structure of a digital system.

				<p>Interested in understanding more about how UX can improve business KPI (key performance indicators), I started looking into how businesses develop products. This was the timeframe I’ve given myself:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Day 1: Finish readings (Case in Point, Victor Cheng’s videos, Pyramid Principle, HBR’s Guide to Data Analytics Basics for Managers)</li>
					<li>Day 2: Assemble framework</li>
					<li>Day 3: Synthesize and work on case studies in Product Design Exercises</li>
				</ul>

				<p>After the readings, I thought of the more interesting question - “How do you bridge the gap between personas and user flow”? Here is what led me towards the direction</p>

				<h2>Day 1: Brainstorming</h2>

				<figcaption><b>Notes</b>: <i>a collection of notes on day 1</i></figcaption>
				<p>I started with Victor Cheng’ s videos as an introduction to business, and then began reading Case in Point’s Ivy Case System. It was quickly evident that the what I needed to focus on was market sizing - to identify segments most worth pursuing, and means to increase sales. Traditional cost cutting measures as well as mergers and acquisitions, did not seem that as relevant to UX.</p>

				<h2>Day 2: Process</h2>

				<figcaption><b>Draft workflow</b>: <i>Quick workflow based on the STP (Segmenting Targeting Positioning) model (possible to zoom in, but not pivotal to the argument)</i></figcaption>
				<p>With the development of the STP model, I started wondering what UX is to me. I enjoy how well-structured the STP model is. But what role does the UX process play in product development? As a UX designer, I felt the need to clarify my thoughts on the matter. With a combination of internet browsing and emailing, I reinforced what UX means to me - the transitioning of user insight into digital systems.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Day 3: Addressing the problem</h2>

				<p>If UX is the transitioning of user insight into digital systems, then I thought there really ought to be a better way to express and understand the way personas relate to user flows. A pseudo user flow, I suppose, that bridges the persona’s journey and the highly technical, spec-level user flow document.</p>
				<img src="https://files.cargocollective.com/c137775/Persona_Flow.png">
				<figcaption><b>Moqups</b>: <i>user flow templates</i></figcaption>
				<p>While it is resonable to assume that anybody who tries hard enough will eventually figure out the logic of the userflows above, they are unintuitive and they obfuscate the role users play in the development of the application.</p>
				<p>Barbara Minto’s Pyramid Principle inspired me to think about organizing the userflow in layers, and so, to give a very simplistic example, this is how GQ’s persona-integrated-sitemap (temp name) would look like. You can already begin to see the advantages of this model. With this model, we develop the screens based on the personas. We know that the first step towards attracting influencers is trend-based articles, buyers culture-based, and the causl reader deal-based. Based on analytics, we can decide which to prioritize. However, we now also have a better understanding of what to put on the home screen. This is key to more complex pages. The latter part is less insightful. We already know that a associative navigation will keep readers engaged.</p>

				<img src="https://files.cargocollective.com/c137775/Persona_GQ.png">
				<figcaption><b>GQ</b>: <i>application 1</i></figcaption>
				<p>Let us move on to a more complex scenario. Unlike GQ, Trivago has a much more complex structure, with a home screen (welcome page), filters, products screen, and details screen. I searched “different kinds of travellers” on google, and found out that there are 3 main factors: locations, price, and timing, that influences a person’s travel decisions. From there, I created 5 main personas. For the sake of this exercise let us assume it is true.</p>

				<p>These are the conclusions you can draw with the personas-integrated-sitemap:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>It suggests that adding a “where do you want to return to” on its main page for return visitors would make trivago a more appealing website to business trip goers and weekenders.</li>
					<li>If we want to serve the daredevils better, it would help to address the question of “When is the cheapest time to go?”. A simple solution is adding a graph of the median price against the time axis. This needs to be further examined.</li>
					<li>A sales-based website would have a upside down, funnel-like structure. Essentially, it is telling us that if there is a singular objective you want to achieve eg. sell a product, you will do well if you manage to address users’ concerns and guide them towards the goal.</li>
					</ol>

				<br><br><br><br>
				<p>While there is still a lot to be tested and examined, I think this model presents opportunities to clarify complex user flows. That is not to say that it should eliminate user flows, but rather to supplement it, and provide a more abstracted view towards the product. I look forward to developing this further and examining this in different contexts.</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<br>
				<p class="HomeP">Hi, thank you for visiting! I am Marvin, currently partaking in “Applications of Digital Analytics and Management Strategies in UX Processes”, a 5 week workshop (Nov-Dec) privately organized by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielhjames/">Daniel James</a>, who previously held positions at BCG (Consultant), Goldman Sachs (Analyst), and Capital One Labs (Director of Product Management). During which, I am able to develop a real life product from ideation to launch, with a focus on using marketing analytics, usability tests, as well as financing strategies to validate and enhance design. It covers all things design related for a startup from branding and web-deisgn, to app design. Best of all, it aligns with my interest in problem solving with design, which is what motivated me to transition into UX.</p>

				<p class="HomeP">In my last three years as a college student, I spent a lot of time exploring different fields, honing my design capabilities along the way. I learnt to manage semester-long projects (HKU Architecture 2016-2018) - to handle photography professionally (New York Fashion Week 2018 F/W Workshop) - the conventions of branding (Constant, Creative Intern Summer 2018) - as well as the fundamentals of UX (General Assembly UX Design Circuit Summer 2018). My major in illustration at Parsons School of Design supports my experimentation in visual communication.</p>
