				<h4>Usability Testing (Qualitative), Branding, Wireframing, On-boarding, UI</h4>
				<h1>Does including branding in the UX workflow actually make the proccess leaner?</h1>
				<br><br>
				<p>In order to reduce waste - anything not used in the MVP, people save visual design for last. During the making of Dylan, I explored the arguments for and against beginning branding earlier. Dylan is an iOS app designed for Adrian To to help users gain financial confidence.</p>

				<p>I designed this in the Summer of 2018, having just finished my internship at a branding firm in Hong Kong. During the time I was there, I contributed to the art direction of Fortune 1000 firm campaigns, branding proposals of startups, Nikon’s instagram campaign, among others. Hoping to be more involved in the validation and development of ideas, I pursued UX by joining General Assembly’s 6-week Design Circuit. I was fortunate to be guided by Jason Early, whose past clients include Nasa and Google.</p>

				<p>Hoping to bring what I have learnt into the program, I thought about incorporating branding earlier into the UX development phase. I drafted the first 2 stages at the beginning of the project. Essentially, I added brand audit, brand persona, and a branded storyboard to the research phase.</p>

				<h2>Observation 1: Close to everything was recycled</h2>
				<p>As I later realized, everything besides <b class="Caption">7. Storyboard A</b> was recycled, meaning that everything was repurposed and used in the final output. Illustrated storyboards, personas, and icons are particularly easy to reuse because of how relevant they are to the final product.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Span-4">
				<h3>For</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>high level storyboards are unlikely to change</li>
					<li>takes about the same time to look for specific stock images</li>
					<li>drawings can still be used for pitch decks/ websites/ other products</li>
					<li>helps the client visualize the output</li>
					<li>there is quite a lot of styling options even if the linework is complete (see <b>13. Art Style Study</b>)</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="Span-4">
				<h3>Against</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>may not be end up being an illustration-heavy app if it is photo-based. Illustrations might not be useful.</li>
					<li>increases the investment into product development - what if the project gets axed after user testing the wireframes?</li>
					<li>depending on how the project is funded, there may be more urgent deliverables that are necessary</li>

				<h2>Observation 2: Branded elements help visualize more complex ideas</h2>
				<p>The final visual design is so important when ideas become increasingly complex. Simply put, wireframing does not necessarily translate to compelling visual design. Diagrams in 12a. Diagram Study are interesting as wireframes, but is not something I can imagine the final product to look like. This is a good example of when UX and UI demands inform each other’s decisions.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Span-4">
				<h3>For</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Beginning branding earlier helps ease the transition into UI, as UI cannot begin until there is at least a vague branding direction. As mentioned in <b class="Caption">6. Brand Persona</b>, we wanted the app to be “your encouraging friend” who will inspire you to achieve your financial goals. While we were happy with the draft styling option in <b class="Caption">12b. Diagram Study</b>, I presented several alternatives to the client for reference after this was approved.</li>
					<li>It also means that if split among larger teams of designers, branding and the discovery process can run concurrent with each other. This speeds up the development process, if the client has the right budget</li>
					<li>Clients are unlikely to user test ideas with poor visual design</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="Span-4">
				<h3>Against</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>The icons are in fact quite flexible (see <b class="Caption">13. Art Style Study</b>). Styles ranging from cartoon to material design. Nevertheless, if the client requests a different set of icons entirely, then the past branding work will have to be completed again.</li>

				<h2>Observation 3: The final branding guide is developed according to the app design</h2>
				<p>Product design branding was not within the scope of my previous internship, and so I was unfamiliar with the practicalities of putting a app branding guideline together. It surprised me how, unlike branding traditional media, you can specify margins, grids, and item sizes for appications in order to provide a stronger brand presences</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Span-4">
				<h3>For</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>This reinforces the idea that branding should be considered in tandem with the UX. Unless the final product is based purely on graphics found in libraries. You will ultimately have to deal with branded assets. </li>
					<li> Towards the end of the project, the client actually agreed to use the persona as the logo, with Dylan as the app name, further reducing waste. It is congruent with the branding idea of “your encouraging friend”, and so the decision felt justified.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="Span-4">
				<h3>Against</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>-</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="Span-8">
				<h2>Conclusion: Yes, leaner, but consider speed + budget vs. less risk</h2>
				<p>While incorporating branding into the UX process makes the overall workflow faster and cheaper, the client has to take on additional risk. More work has to be completed before main UX milestones are reached. On the other hand, completing branding later and reevaluating complex visual designs again means that some backtracking would occur. That makes the process even more expensive. Which is better? To brand or not to brand - it depends.</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<br>
				<p class="HomeP">Hi, thank you for visiting! I am Marvin, currently partaking in “Applications of Digital Analytics and Management Strategies in UX Processes”, a 5 week workshop (Nov-Dec) privately organized by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielhjames/">Daniel James</a>, who previously held positions at BCG (Consultant), Goldman Sachs (Analyst), and Capital One Labs (Director of Product Management). During which, I am able to develop a real life product from ideation to launch, with a focus on using marketing analytics, usability tests, as well as financing strategies to validate and enhance design. It covers all things design related for a startup from branding and web-deisgn, to app design. Best of all, it aligns with my interest in problem solving with design, which is what motivated me to transition into UX.</p>

				<p class="HomeP">In my last three years as a college student, I spent a lot of time exploring different fields, honing my design capabilities along the way. I learnt to manage semester-long projects (HKU Architecture 2016-2018) - to handle photography professionally (New York Fashion Week 2018 F/W Workshop) - the conventions of branding (Constant, Creative Intern Summer 2018) - as well as the fundamentals of UX (General Assembly UX Design Circuit Summer 2018). My major in illustration at Parsons School of Design supports my experimentation in visual communication.</p>
