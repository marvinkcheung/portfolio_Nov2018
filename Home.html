		<h1>Hi! I'm Marvin, currently a student at Parsons School of Design in New York.</h1>
		<br>
		<p>I transferred to Parsons, from an Architecture degree at the University of Hong Kong, as my interests gravitated towards designing digital systems I enjoy addressing the vast range of problems in UX and validating solutions while bringing my past experience from branding. Currently majoring in Illustration, I split my time between experimenting with visual communication and coding Web/ App experiences.</p>

	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Hi, thank you for visiting! I am Marvin, currently partaking in “Applications of Digital Analytics and Management Strategies in UX Processes”, a 5 week workshop (Nov-Dec) privately organized by Dan James, who previously held positions at BCG (Consultant), Goldman Sachs (Analyst), and Capital One Labs (Director of Product Management). During which, I am able to develop a real life product from ideation to launch, with a focus on using marketing analytics, usability tests, as well as financing strategies to validate and enhance design. It covers all things design related for a startup from branding and web-deisgn, to app design. It aligns with my interest in problem solving with design, which is what motivated me to transition into UX.</p>

	<p>In my last three years as a college student, I spent a lot of time exploring different fields, honing my design capabilities along the way. I learnt to manage semester-long projects (HKU Architecture 2016-2018) - to handle photography professionally (New York Fashion Week 2018 F/W Workshop) - the conventions of branding (Constant, Creative Intern Summer 2018) - as well as the fundamentals of UX (General Assembly UX Design Circuit Summer 2018). Majoring in Illustration at Parsons School of Design enabled a lot of these explorations, the way it encourages me to experiment with visual communication.</p>
